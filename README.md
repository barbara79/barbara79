# 👋 Hi, I'm Barbara

** Backend Developer | API Governance & Observability Specialist**

I am a Backend Developer with over 7 years of experience building scalable enterprise SaaS and E-commerce solutions. I specialize in the full lifecycle of **Backend Engineering**: from data modeling and API design to high-level observability and performance optimization.

With a professional background that began in enterprise operations at **General Electric**, I bring a unique "ownership mindset" to engineering, bridging the gap between complex business logic and robust technical implementation.
